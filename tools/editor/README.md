**This tool is heavily a work in progress**

It's utilitarian, but usable to describe mint layouts quickly.

- `shift+i` import json (on web: drag and drop only)
- `shift+e` export json 
- `ctrl/cmd+d` duplicate (doesn't parent, weird placement)
- other keys are obvious (escape, delete, enter)

Please note the json format might change, along with everything else.
